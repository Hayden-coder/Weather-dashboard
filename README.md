# Weather-dashboard
<p>In this weeks homework we needed to make a weather dashboard.<p>
<p>the user enters the name of a city (either just the city name, or "city, state") in the search field, then clicks the search button<p>
<p>Every time a user searches for a city, a button displaying that search information is created underneath the search field. When the user clicks on that button, a new search is executed for that location. Additionally, if the user closes the window or refreshes the browser, the search history buttons remain, and the app will open up with weather results for the last city the user searched for.Used Current Weather Data and5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast.<p>
